# First Week CaptureTheFlag Challenge!

**For the First Week weâ€™ll go easy on you. We prepared 5 different challenge that will test what you learned this week**

Start by putting your **wba-wallet** inside the wallet folder and copying the **IDL** from Solscan/SolanaFM into the program folder. ProgramID = ctf1VWeMtgxa24zZevsXqDg6xvcMVy4FbP3cxLCpGha

We convienetly created an airdrop script so if you're out of devnet sol you can just run **"yarn airdrop"**.

Each challenge has it's own "createMint#.ts" so you don't make any mistakes since we're gonna play with that stuff a lot. For the Fungible Token Task (Challenge4) we even created a "createMetadata4.ts" so it's convenient for you.

## Now let's start with the challenges!

Start by going to the **startCtf.ts** file and create your own profile before starting the challenges.

* **Challenge 1 â†’ go to challenge1.ts.** The objective of this challenge is to send **0.00000000000001** amount of token to the Vault.\
_Yes, that's 14 decimals, you don't have to count them, maybe I said to much..._

* **Challenge 2 â†’ go to challenge2.ts.** The objective of this challenge is to send **#@%** amount of token to the Vault.\
_The document seems to be buggedâ€¦ i wonder if anyone have already sent the right amount of token, maybe someone that tested itâ€¦_

* **Challenge 3 â†’ go to challenge3.ts.** The objective of this challenge is to create a new token Mint and give the authority to mint token to the Smart Contract Authority.\
_If only I could remember what the publickey of the Authority is...I for sure wrote that somewhere in my codeâ€¦ Welp, not my problem i guess_

* **Challenge 4 â†’ go to challenge4.ts.** The objective of this challenge is to mint & send to the vault a token with **WBA** as name in the metadata.

* **Challenge 5 â†’ go to challenge5.ts.** The objective of this challenge is to create a new token Mint and give the Freeze Authority to the Smart Contract Authority.\
_Yes, it's the same of before, we have spared you some scuff work because we feel generous..._


Before celebrating your victory go to **completeCtf.ts** and make sure to run the script so weâ€™ll know youâ€™re done! This script is very important because it will change your profile from a non-completed-CTF profile to a completed-CTF profile. If youâ€™re interested go see that on the explorer ðŸ¤ª

**NB: Since this should be fun for everyone, if youâ€™re stuck with a problem donâ€™t hesitate to contact Leo or Andre. And to not ruin the fun for everyone we ask to not spoil where to find the missing piece of code are and how to find it!**

_Maybe this can help... don't know..._\
